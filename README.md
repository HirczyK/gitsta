gitsta
======
Responsive, minimalistic, clean and content-oriented theme, inspired by GitHub. Mainly designed for programmers, but suitable for any bloggers.

### Download
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HirczyK/gitsta/releases)
- [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/themes/gitsta)

##### Additional
- Enable markdown support for comments (markdown preview & help) via Admin > Appearance > Gitsta (there aren't that many options :))

### Requirements & Recommendation
* This theme requires at least PHP 5.3, due the usage of closures within the `functions.php`
* Since this theme was created with markdown in mind, you should use some kind of markdown plugin (I'm pretty satisfied with [WP-Markdown](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown/)). If you don't like to use markdown, you can disable the markdown support within the theme settings.

[Live Demo](http://www.doecode.net)

### Installation
- Clone the git repo `git clone https://github.com/HirczyK/gitsta.git` or download the zip file

- Copy the `gitsta`-folder into `/wp-content/themes/`

- Activate the theme.

- Enjoy.

##### Additional
- Enable markdown support for comments (markdown preview & help) via Admin > Appearance > Gitsta (there aren't that many options :))
- If the navigation menu is missing go to Admin > Appereance > Menus and create a menu.

### Requirements & Recommendation
* This theme requires at least PHP 5.3, due the usage of closures within the `functions.php`
* Since this theme was created with markdown in mind, you should use some kind of markdown plugin (I'm pretty satisfied with [WP-Markdown](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown/)). If you don't like to use markdown, you can disable the markdown support within the theme settings.
